## **Who did this project ?**

Team members : [Aurélie](https://github.com/Avanhellemont) et [Danaé](https://github.com/Da-nae).

## **Who took what part ?**

Aurélie : Header, About Us section, Category section and hamburger menu.
Danaé : Footer, Gallery section, Specials section, Chefs section and responsive adaptation.

## **Why create this projet ?**

It's a Becode Challenge, the goal is training our team work, CSS skills, Sass skills, Git skills and HTML skills.

## **What language are used?**

HTML and SCSS.

## **What the easiest part ?**

Aurélie : the HTML semantic and the prototype on Figma.
Danaé : the HTML semantic and the SCSS.

## **What the hardest part ?**

Aurélie : the organization of Sass files (too many lines of code !).
Danaé : the responsive part on different work made by others.

Both : As our first team project with git and sass, we feel that it's not yet the best it can be. We hope to be faster in the future without the muddling of the first try !
